            <div class="book-synopsis">Luca Windsor is convinced he hates the secretary his grandmother assigned him, but he knows he can't function without her either. Valentina is highly professional, and always a step ahead of him. Despite his insistence that he'd never want her, he loses his composure the second his grandmother mentions pairing her up with another man. A dance leads to a kiss, and the lines are blurred. Except...Luca has always known he'd end up in an arranged marriage, and he knows Valentina isn't on his grandmother's list (or so our silly hero thinks). He attempts to distance himself from her again, but is unable to, going as far as reinforcing a companywide anti-dating policy to keep her from seeing anyone else. When Valentina experiences a personal crisis, he demands the ultimate price for help he'd, unbeknownst to her, already given her: her hand in marriage. The two start a marriage of convenience, and along the way, they learn they're better suited than they ever thought possible, leading them to rethink the 3-year timeline they put on their marriage.</div>

            <div class="book-synopsis">"The reigning queen of STEM romance."—The Washington Post An Indie Next and Library Reads Pick! Rival physicists collide in a vortex of academic feuds and fake dating shenanigans in this delightfully STEMinist romcom from the New York Times bestselling author of The Love Hypothesis and Love on the Brain. The many lives of theoretical physicist Elsie Hannaway have finally caught up with her. By day, she’s an adjunct professor, toiling away at grading labs and teaching thermodynamics in the hopes of landing tenure. By other day, Elsie makes up for her non-existent paycheck by offering her services as a fake girlfriend, tapping into her expertly honed people-pleasing skills to embody whichever version of herself the client needs. Honestly, it’s a pretty sweet gig—until her carefully constructed Elsie-verse comes crashing down. Because Jack Smith, the annoyingly attractive and arrogant older brother of her favorite client, turns out to be the cold-hearted experimental physicist who ruined her mentor’s career and undermined the reputation of theorists everywhere. And he’s the same Jack Smith who rules over the physics department at MIT, standing right between Elsie and her dream job. Elsie is prepared for an all-out war of scholarly sabotage but…those long, penetrating looks? Not having to be anything other than her true self when she’s with him? Will falling into an experimentalist’s orbit finally tempt her to put her most guarded theories on love into practice?</div>

THIS SPECIAL EDITION includes deleted scenes, a playlist and a personal note from the author. While stocks last. Charlie Davis is in pieces. At seventeen, she’s already lost more than most people lose in a lifetime. But she’s learned how to forget it through cutting; the pain washes out the sorrow until there is nothing but calm. She doesn't have to think about her father or what happened under the bridge. Her best friend, Ellis, who is gone forever. Or the mother who has nothing left to give her. Kicked out of a special treatment center when her insurance runs out, Charlie finds herself in the bright and wild landscape of Tucson, Arizona, where she begins the unthinkable: the long journey of putting herself back together. Kathleen Glasgow is also the author of How to Make Friends with the Dark and You'd Be Home Now ‘Girl, Interrupted meets Speak.’ Refinery29 ‘Glasgow’s poetic writing brings Charlie’s mind to life as she tries to find a path to recovery.’ Independent</div>

            <div class="book-synopsis">The bestselling introduction to bioinformatics and genomics – now in its third edition Widely received in its previous editions, Bioinformatics and Functional Genomics offers the most broad-based introduction to this explosive new discipline. Now in a thoroughly updated and expanded third edition, it continues to be the go-to source for students and professionals involved in biomedical research. This book provides up-to-the-minute coverage of the fields of bioinformatics and genomics. Features new to this edition include: Extensive revisions and a slight reorder of chapters for a more effective organization A brand new chapter on next-generation sequencing An expanded companion website, also updated as and when new information becomes available Greater emphasis on a computational approach, with clear guidance of how software tools work and introductions to the use of command-line tools such as software for next-generation sequence analysis, the R programming language, and NCBI search utilities The book is complemented by lavish illustrations and more than 500 figures and tables - many newly-created for the third edition to enhance clarity and understanding. Each chapter includes learning objectives, a problem set, pitfalls section, boxes explaining key techniques and mathematics/statistics principles, a summary, recommended reading, and a list of freely available software. Readers may visit a related Web page for supplemental information such as PowerPoints and audiovisual files of lectures, and videocasts of how to perform many basic operations: www.wiley.com/go/pevsnerbioinformatics. Bioinformatics and Functional Genomics, Third Edition serves as an excellent single-source textbook for advanced undergraduate and beginning graduate-level courses in the biological sciences and computer sciences. It is also an indispensable resource for biologists in a broad variety of disciplines who use the tools of bioinformatics and genomics to study particular research problems; bioinformaticists and computer scientists who develop computer algorithms and databases; and medical researchers and clinicians who want to understand the genomic basis of viral, bacterial, parasitic, or other diseases.</div>
