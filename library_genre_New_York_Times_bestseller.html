Glittering with wit, heart, and humour, it’s a book to share with every woman you’ve ever been lucky enough to call a friend. “Nearly everything I know about love, I&#39;ve learnt from my long-term friendships with women.” I know that love can be loud and jubilant. It can be dancing in the swampy mud and the pouring rain at a festival and shouting “YOU ARE AMAZING” over the band. It’s laughing until you wheeze. It’s walking along the street together on a Saturday night and feeling an entire city is yours. I also know that love is a pretty quiet thing. It’s lying on the sofa together drinking coffee, talking about where you’re going to go that morning to drink more coffee. It’s folding down pages of books you think they’d find interesting. I know that love happens under the splendour of fireworks and sunsets, but also happens when you’re lying on blow-up airbeds in a childhood bedroom, sitting in A&E or in the queue for a passport. ***** WHAT READERS ARE SAYING: ‘A book every girl in her 20s needs to read’ ‘I’ll never stop recommending this book’ ‘This is my comfort book!

I devoured it in one gulp!” —Maria Semple A warm, incisive new novel about the enduring bonds of marriage and friendship from Cynthia D’Aprix Sweeney, author of the instant New York Times bestseller The Nest Flora Mancini has been happily married for more than twenty years. But everything she thought she knew about herself, her marriage, and her relationship with her best friend, Margot, is upended when she stumbles upon an envelope containing her husband’s wedding ring—the one he claimed he lost one summer when their daughter, Ruby, was five. Flora and Julian struggled for years, scraping together just enough acting work to raise Ruby in Manhattan and keep Julian’s small theater company—Good Company—afloat. A move to Los Angeles brought their first real career successes, a chance to breathe easier, and a reunion with Margot, now a bona fide television star. But has their new life been built on lies? What happened that summer all those years ago? And what happens now? With Cynthia D’Aprix Sweeney’s signature tenderness, humor, and insight, Good Company tells a bighearted story of the lifelong relationships that both wound and heal us.

            <div class="book-card" data-full-description="#1 NATIONAL BESTSELLER • A passionate call to arms against our era’s most pervasive human rights violation—the oppression of women and girls in the developing world. From the bestselling authors of Tightrope, two of our most fiercely moral voices With Pulitzer Prize winners Nicholas D. Kristof and Sheryl WuDunn as our guides, we undertake an odyssey through Africa and Asia to meet the extraordinary women struggling there, among them a Cambodian teenager sold into sex slavery and an Ethiopian woman who suffered devastating injuries in childbirth. Drawing on the breadth of their combined reporting experience, Kristof and WuDunn depict our world with anger, sadness, clarity, and, ultimately, hope. They show how a little help can transform the lives of women and girls abroad. That Cambodian girl eventually escaped from her brothel and, with assistance from an aid group, built a thriving retail business that supports her family. The Ethiopian woman had her injuries repaired and in time became a surgeon. A Zimbabwean mother of five, counseled to return to school, earned her doctorate and became an expert on AIDS. Through these stories, Kristof and WuDunn help us see that the key to economic progress lies in unleashing women’s potential. They make clear how so many people have helped to do just that, and how we can each do our part. Throughout much of the world, the greatest unexploited economic resource is the female half of the population. Countries such as China have prospered precisely because they emancipated women and brought them into the formal economy. Unleashing that process globally is not only the right thing to do; it’s also the best strategy for fighting poverty. Deeply felt, pragmatic, and inspirational, Half the Sky is essential reading for every global citizen.">

Sallie had other plans. Sallie Kincaid is the daughter of the biggest man in a small town, the charismatic Duke Kincaid. Born at the turn of the twentieth century into a life of comfort and privilege, Sallie remembers little about her mother, who died in a violent argument with the Duke. By the time she is just eight years old, the Duke has remarried and had a son, Eddie. While Sallie is the Duke&#39;s daughter, sharp-witted and resourceful, Eddie is his mother’s son, timid and cerebral. When Sallie tries to teach young Eddie to be more like their father, her daredevil coaching leads to an accident, and Sallie is cast out. Nine years later, she returns, determined to reclaim her place in the family. That’s a lot more complicated than Sallie expected, and she enters a world of conflict and lawlessness. Sallie confronts the secrets and scandals that hide in the shadows of the Big House, navigates the factions in the family and town, and finally comes into her own as a bold, sometimes reckless bootlegger. &#39;Jeannette Walls created my new favorite hero in her protagonist, Sallie Kincaid. Sallie is sharp, bold, unflinching, and humorous despite, or maybe because of, her hardships.&#39; — Jennette McCurdy, bestselling author of I’m Glad My Mom Died &#39;Hang the Moon is Jeannette Walls&#39;s masterwork. Epic in scope, the novel is a thrill ride through Prohibition and change in the American South . . . The prose is so elegant and so close to the bone you feel Sallie&#39;s heartbeat.

You can agree or disagree with Smil—accept or doubt his ‘just the facts’ posture—but you probably shouldn’t ignore him.”—The Washington Post An essential analysis of the modern science and technology that makes our twenty-first century lives possible—a scientist&#39;s investigation into what science really does, and does not, accomplish. We have never had so much information at our fingertips and yet most of us don’t know how the world really works. This book explains seven of the most fundamental realities governing our survival and prosperity. From energy and food production, through our material world and its globalization, to risks, our environment and its future, How the World Really Works offers a much-needed reality check—because before we can tackle problems effectively, we must understand the facts. In this ambitious and thought-provoking book we see, for example, that globalization isn’t inevitable—the foolishness of allowing 70 per cent of the world’s rubber gloves to be made in just one factory became glaringly obvious in 2020—and that our societies have been steadily increasing their dependence on fossil fuels, such that any promises of decarbonization by 2050 are a fairy tale. For example, each greenhouse-grown supermarket-bought tomato has the equivalent of five tablespoons of diesel embedded in its production, and we have no way of producing steel, cement or plastics at required scales without huge carbon emissions. Ultimately, Smil answers the most profound question of our age: are we irrevocably doomed or is a brighter utopia ahead? Compelling, data-rich and revisionist, this wonderfully broad, interdisciplinary guide finds faults with both extremes. Looking at the world through this quantitative lens reveals hidden truths that change the way we see our past, present and uncertain future.">

While books can be enjoyed for their basic stories, there are often deeper literary meanings beneath the surface. How to Read Literature Like a Professor helps us to discover those hidden truths by looking at literature with the practiced analytical eye—and the literary codes—of a college professor. What does it mean when a protagonist is traveling along a dusty road? When he hands a drink to his companion? When he’s drenched in a sudden rain shower? Thomas C. Foster provides answers to these questions as he explores every aspect of fiction, from major themes to literary models, narrative devices, and form. Offering a broad overview of literature—a world where a road leads to a quest, a shared meal may signify a communion, and rain, whether cleansing or destructive, is never just a shower—he shows us how to make our reading experience more intellectually satisfying and fun. The world, and curricula, have changed. This third edition has been thoroughly revised to reflect those changes, and features new chapters, a new preface and epilogue, as well as fresh teaching points Foster has developed over the past decade. Foster updates the books he discusses to include more diverse, inclusive, and modern works, such as Angie Thomas’s The Hate U Give; Emily St. John Mandel’s Station Eleven; Neil Gaiman’s Neverwhere; Elizabeth Acevedo’s The Poet X; Helen Oyeyemi&#39;s Mr. Fox and Boy, Snow, Bird; Sandra Cisneros’s The House on Mango Street; Zora Neale Hurston’s Their Eyes Were Watching God; Maggie O’Farrell’s Hamnet; Madeline Miller’s Circe; Pat Barker’s The Silence of the Girls; and Tahereh Mafi’s A Very Large Expanse of Sea.">

            <div class="book-card" data-full-description="“The most interesting book ever written about Google” (The Washington Post) delivers the inside story behind the most successful and admired technology company of our time, now updated with a new Afterword. Google is arguably the most important company in the world today, with such pervasive influence that its name is a verb. The company founded by two Stanford graduate students—Larry Page and Sergey Brin—has become a tech giant known the world over. Since starting with its search engine, Google has moved into mobile phones, computer operating systems, power utilities, self-driving cars, all while remaining the most powerful company in the advertising business. Granted unprecedented access to the company, Levy disclosed that the key to Google’s success in all these businesses lay in its engineering mindset and adoption of certain internet values such as speed, openness, experimentation, and risk-taking. Levy discloses details behind Google’s relationship with China, including how Brin disagreed with his colleagues on the China strategy—and why its social networking initiative failed; the first time Google tried chasing a successful competitor. He examines Google’s rocky relationship with government regulators, particularly in the EU, and how it has responded when employees left the company for smaller, nimbler start-ups. In the Plex is the “most authoritative…and in many ways the most entertaining” (James Gleick, The New York Book Review) account of Google to date and offers “an instructive primer on how the minds behind the world’s most influential internet company function” (Richard Waters, The Wall Street Journal).">

Billie, Mary Alice, Helen and Natalie have worked for the Museum, an elite network of assassins, for forty years.

When the foursome is sent on an all-expenses-paid trip to mark their retirement, they are targeted by one of their own. Only the Board, the top-level members of the Museum, can order the termination of field agents, and the women realise they&#39;ve been marked for death. To get out alive they have to turn against their own organization, relying on experience and each other to get the job done, knowing that working together is the secret to their survival.

Él estaba convencido de esto y, si tú lo hubieras conocido, tampoco habrías dudado en asegurar que pertenecía al montón, ni más, ni menos. Y así era, hasta el día en que la Altísima Dirección llama a este funcionario del Departamento Encargado de los Jóvenes Mágicos para supervisar un orfanato del que apenas hay registros. Con esta nueva tarea entre manos, Linus viajará a la isla de Marsyas, donde deberá supervisar a seis huérfanos catalogados como peligrosos (hablamos del futuro Anticristo, entre otros) y a su enigmático tutor. Ahí, deberá dejar de lado sus miedos y prejuicios, que no son pocos, para darse cuenta de que lo que realmente tiene que hacer no es aquello a lo que fue enviado. Porque en Marsyas, Linus descubrirá que el camino a la felicidad es distinto para cada uno de nosotros, y que si te atreves a recorrerlo, llegarás al lugar donde te encontrarás a ti mismo.

But exactly right for ours Chemist Elizabeth Zott is not your average woman. In fact, she would be the first to point out that there is no such thing. But it&#39;s the early 1960s and her all-male team at Hastings Research Institute take a very unscientific view of equality. Except for one: Calvin Evans, the lonely, brilliant, Nobel-Prize-nominated grudge-holder who falls in love with - of all things - her mind. Like science, life is unpredictable. Forced to leave her job at the institute, Elizabeth Zott soon finds herself the reluctant star of America&#39;s most beloved cooking show, Supper at Six. Elizabeth&#39;s unusual approach to cooking (&#39;Combine one tablespoon acetic acid with a pinch of sodium chloride&#39;) proves revolutionary. But as her following grows, not everyone is happy. Because as it turns out, Elizabeth Zott isn&#39;t just teaching women to cook. She&#39;s daring them to change the status quo.

            <div class="book-card" data-full-description="Ganadora del Premio Pulitzer 1992 Maus nos cuenta la historia de Vladek Spiegelman, un judío superviviente del Holocausto, y de su hijo, un historietista que intenta reconciliarse con su padre, con la terrible historia de este y con la mismísima Historia. La forma de este relato, un cómic (donde los nazis son gatos y los judíos, ratones), logra desposeernos de cualquier atisbo de cercanía que podamos tener con los hechos que aquí se refieren, y lo consigue precisamente porque se acerca a lo inefable empleando formas diminutivas. Como ha señalado el New York Times Book Review, este libro es «un formidable hito, que aporta el detalle de un documental y la viveza de una novela… un suceso literario de primer orden». A medio camino entre Polonia y Rego Park, en Nueva York, Maus detalla dos historias poderosas: la primera es el relato de cómo el padre de Spiegelman y su esposa sobrevivieron a la Europa de Hitler, una narración espeluznante llena de incontables encontronazos con la muerte, de escapatorias improbables y de sentimiento de terror ante la posibilidad del arresto y la traición; la segunda trata de la relación tortuosa que el autor mantiene con su padre en la vejez, en un intento de llevarse bien con él y que, sin embargo, está trufado de pequeñas discusiones y visitas intermitentes, mientras al fondo acecha un legado histórico tan gigantesco que impide ningún tipo de sosiego. A todos los niveles, este es el relato definitivo de un superviviente… y también el de los hijos que, de algún modo, tienen que sobrevivir a los supervivientes. La parte I de Maus nos conduce, de la mano de los padres de Spiegelman, hasta las puertas de Auschwitz, y asimismo nos arrima al abatimiento que siente su hijo. Hay que dejar atrás nuestras ideas preconcebidas. Estos gatos y estos ratones no son Tom y Jerry, sino algo muy diferente. Esto es un nuevo tipo de literatura. ENGLISH DESCRIPTION The bestselling first installment of the graphic novel acclaimed as “the most affecting and successful narrative ever done about the Holocaust” (Wall Street Journal) and “the first masterpiece in comic book history” (The New Yorker) PULITZER PRIZE WINNER One of Variety’s “Banned and Challenged Books Everyone Should Read” A brutally moving work of art —widely hailed as the greatest graphic novel ever written— Maus recounts the chilling experiences of the author’s father during the Holocaust, with Jews drawn as wide-eyed mice and Nazis as menacing cats. Maus is a haunting tale within a tale, weaving the author’s account of his tortured relationship with his aging father into an astonishing retelling of one of history&#39;s most unspeakable tragedies. It is an unforgettable story of survival and a disarming look at the legacy of trauma.">

Will, no. Ahora, ella vive en la casa de su niñez, regenta el resort de su madre en Muskoka, que está hecho un desastre, y necesita un salvavidas.

            <div class="book-card" data-full-description="Ken Follett regresa al thriller con una vertiginosa novela que imagina lo inimaginable. En el desierto del Sáhara, dos agentes de inteligencia siguen la pista a un poderoso grupo terrorista arriesgando sus vidas -y, cuando se enamoran perdidamente, sus carreras- a cada paso. En China, un alto cargo del gobierno con grandes ambiciones batalla contra los viejos halcones del ala dura del Partido que amenazan con empujar al país a un punto de no retorno. Y en Estados Unidos, la presidenta se enfrenta a una crisis global y al asedio de sus implacables oponentes políticos. Está dispuesta a todo para evitar una guerra innecesaria. Pero cuando un acto de agresión conduce a otro y las potencias más poderosas del mundo se ven atrapadas en una compleja red de alianzas de la que no pueden escapar, comienza una frenética carrera contrarreloj. ¿Podrá alguien, incluso con las mejores intenciones y las más excepcionales habilidades, detener lo inevitable? Nunca es un thriller extraordinario, lleno de heroínas y villanos, falsos profetas, agentes de élite, políticos desencantados y cínicos revolucionarios. Follett envía un mensaje de advertencia para nuestros tiempos en una historia intensa y trepidante que transporta a los lectores hasta el filo del abismo. «Cuando me documentaba para La caída de los gigantes, me impactó darme cuenta de que la Primera Guerra Mundial fue una guerra que nadie quería. Ningún líder europeo de ninguno de los dos bandos tenía intención de que sucediera. Pero, uno por uno, los emperadores y primeros ministros tomaron decisiones -decisiones lógicas y moderadas- que nos acercaron un pasito más al conflicto más terrible que el mundo ha conocido. Llegué a creer que todo fue un trágico accidente. Y me pregunté: ¿podría volver a ocurrir?» KEN FOLLETT La crítica ha dicho: « Nunca es el mejor libro de Ken Follett. Es aterrador. Desafío a cualquiera a abandonarlo tras haber leído las primeras 150 páginas». Stephen King «Un thriller brutal. Puro Ken Follett». Jacinto Antón, El País «No pueden perderse Nunca. Lo van a pasar terriblemente bien». Pepa Fernández, RNE «Una de las mejores novelas de espías que he leído en bastante tiempo». Sergio Vila-Sanjuán, La Vanguardia «Follett tiene una de las imaginaciones más brillantes y desbordantes de la literatura contemporánea». Javier del Pino, Cadena SER «Un adictivo thriller político que ya se perfila como otro best seller mundial». El Mundo «Urgente y ferozmente apasionante». The Washington Post «Un thriller deslumbrante y una de las lecturas más emocionantes del año». Daily Express «Audaz en su escala y meticulosamente documentado, Nunca hace que el resto de libros de espionaje internacional parezcan apocados, perezosos y provincianos». The Sunday Times «Prepárense para una experiencia electrizante». CNN.com «Absolutamente fascinante... Un thriller inteligente, aterrador y muy plausible». Booklist «Fantástico... Una imponente y poderosa demostración de uno de los mejores escritores del género». Publishers Weekly Sobre el autor han dicho: «Follett es un maestro». The Washington Post «Sigo envidiando como el primer día la capacidad de Follett para entretener. Sus tramas funcionan siempre y te mantiene pegado a cada página». Juan Gómez Jurado, ABC">

            <div class="book-card" data-full-description="THE NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER ONE OF BARACK OBAMA&#39;S FAVOURITE BOOKS OF 2023 A searing study of American poverty from the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of Evicted The United States is the richest country on earth, yet has more poverty than any other advanced democracy. One in seven Americans live below the poverty line, a line which hasn&#39;t shifted over the last fifty years, despite the efforts of successive governments. Why is there so much scarcity in this land of dollars? In Poverty, by America, acclaimed sociologist Matthew Desmond examines American poverty today and the stories we tell ourselves about it. Spanning social isolation, mass incarceration, the housing crisis, domestic violence, crack and opioid epidemics, welfare cuts and more, Desmond argues that poverty does not result from a lack of resources or good policy ideas. We already know how to eliminate it. The hard part is getting more of us to care. To do so, we need a new story. As things stand, liberals explain poverty through insurmountable structural issues, whereas conservatives highlight personal failings and poor life choices. Both abdicate responsibility, and ignore the reality that the advantages of the rich only come at the expense of the poor. It is time better-paid citizens put themselves back in the narrative, recognizing that the depth and expanse of poverty in any nation reflects our failure to look out for one another. Poverty must ultimately be met by community: all this suffering and want is our doing, and we can undo it.">

Makes you smarter with every page&#39; - James Clear, author of Atomic Habits The essential guide to improving your performance, and a powerful argument for how to succeed in any field: develop broad interests and skills while everyone around you is rushing to specialize. The instant Sunday Times bestseller From the ‘10,000 hours rule’ to the power of tiger parenting, we have been taught that success in any field requires early specialization and many hours of deliberate practice. If you only dabble or delay, you&#39;ll never catch up with those who got a head start. This is completely wrong. In this landmark book, David Epstein shows you that the way to succeed is by sampling widely, gaining a breadth of experiences, taking detours, experimenting relentlessly and juggling many interests – this is the power of developing range. Studying the world&#39;s most successful athletes, artists, musicians, inventors and scientists, Epstein demonstrates why, in most fields, generalists, not specialists, are primed to excel. Range has challenged the status quo, reshaped career paths and changed lives. Read it to view the world differently.

            <div class="book-card" data-full-description="#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • A bold work from the author of The Black Swan that challenges many of our long-held beliefs about risk and reward, politics and religion, finance and personal responsibility In his most provocative and practical book yet, one of the foremost thinkers of our time redefines what it means to understand the world, succeed in a profession, contribute to a fair and just society, detect nonsense, and influence others. Citing examples ranging from Hammurabi to Seneca, Antaeus the Giant to Donald Trump, Nassim Nicholas Taleb shows how the willingness to accept one’s own risks is an essential attribute of heroes, saints, and flourishing people in all walks of life. As always both accessible and iconoclastic, Taleb challenges long-held beliefs about the values of those who spearhead military interventions, make financial investments, and propagate religious faiths. Among his insights: • For social justice, focus on symmetry and risk sharing. You cannot make profits and transfer the risks to others, as bankers and large corporations do. You cannot get rich without owning your own risk and paying for your own losses. Forcing skin in the game corrects this asymmetry better than thousands of laws and regulations. • Ethical rules aren’t universal. You’re part of a group larger than you, but it’s still smaller than humanity in general. • Minorities, not majorities, run the world. The world is not run by consensus but by stubborn minorities imposing their tastes and ethics on others. • You can be an intellectual yet still be an idiot. “Educated philistines” have been wrong on everything from Stalinism to Iraq to low-carb diets. • Beware of complicated solutions (that someone was paid to find). A simple barbell can build muscle better than expensive new machines. • True religion is commitment, not just faith. How much you believe in something is manifested only by what you’re willing to risk for it. The phrase “skin in the game” is one we have often heard but rarely stopped to truly dissect. It is the backbone of risk management, but it’s also an astonishingly rich worldview that, as Taleb shows in this book, applies to all aspects of our lives. As Taleb says, “The symmetry of skin in the game is a simple rule that’s necessary for fairness and justice, and the ultimate BS-buster,” and “Never trust anyone who doesn’t have skin in the game. Without it, fools and crooks will benefit, and their mistakes will never come back to haunt them.”">

Son of Hamas is now available with an all-new chapter about events since the book’s release such as the revelation of Mosab’s Israeli intelligence handler’s true identity, and Homeland Security’s effort to deport the author. Since he was a small boy, Mosab Hassan Yousef has had an inside view of the deadly terrorist group Hamas. The oldest son of Sheikh Hassan Yousef, a founding member of Hamas and its most popular leader, young Mosab assisted his father for years in his political activities while being groomed to assume his legacy, politics, status . . . and power. But everything changed when Mosab turned away from terror and violence, and embraced instead the teachings of another famous Middle East leader. In Son of Hamas, Mosab reveals new information about the world’s most dangerous terrorist organization and unveils the truth about his own role, his agonizing separation from family and homeland, the dangerous decision to make his newfound faith public, and his belief that the Christian mandate to “love your enemies” is the only way to peace in the Middle East.">

That is, until Joe Pickett makes two surprising discoveries while hunting down a wounded elk on his district as an epic spring storm descends upon him. First, he finds the professor’s vehicle parked on a remote mountainside. Then Joe finds the professor’s frozen and mutilated body. When he attempts to learn more, his investigation is obstructed by federal agents, extremists, and Governor Colter Allen. Nate Romanowski is rebuilding his falconry company—and financing this through crypto mining with the assistance of Geronimo Jones. He’s then approached by a shadowy group of local militant activists that is gaining in power and influence, and demanding that Wyoming join other western states and secede from the union—by force, if necessary. They ask Nate to throw in with them, but he’s wary. Should he trust them, or is he being set up? As a storm of peril gathers around them, Joe and Nate confront it in different ways—and maybe, for the first time, on opposite sides.">

UNO DE LOS 30 MEJORES NOVELAS HISTÓRICAS DE TODOS LOS TIEMPOS SEGÚN ELLE Érase una vez un pueblo donde las noches eran largas y la muerte contaba su propia historia. En el pueblo vivía una niña que quería leer, un hombre que tocaba el acordeón y un joven judío que escribía bellos cuentos para escapar del horror de la guerra. Al cabo de un tiempo, la niña se convirtió en una ladrona que robaba libros y regalaba palabras. Con estas palabras se escribió una historia hermosa y cruel que ahora ya es una novela inolvidable. La crítica ha dicho... «Un libro imprescindible y, desde luego, una de las novelas históricas más recomendadas si te gusta la buena literatura». Begoña Alonso, Elle « La ladrona de libros deslumbra por sus extraordinarios personajes, su capacidad de emocionar sin clichés y, ante todo, por su omnipresente reflexión sobre el valor de las palabras.» Ricard Ruiz Garzón, El Periódico de Catalunya «La esperanza de Liesel es inexpugnable... Los lectores jóvenes necesitan este tipo de alternativas a la rigidez ideológica, así como exploraciones sobre la importancia de las historias. Y, pensándolo bien, también los adultos.» The New York Times «Elegante, filosófica, conmovedora, bella e importante.» Kirkus Reviews «Merece estar junto al Diario de Ana Frank en nuestra biblioteca.» USA Today «Una narrativa extraordinaria.» SLJ «Zusak no endulza nada, pero logra que un tema aparentemente triste resulte tolerable tal como lo hizo Kurt Vonnegut en Matadero cinco: con un humor sombrío, reconfortante.» Time Magazine «Un gran logro. [...] Un libro desafiante en extensión y tema.» Publishers Weekly «Uno de los libros más esperados en años.» The Wall Street Journal">

            <div class="book-card" data-full-description="From the New York Times bestselling author of Start With Why and Leaders Eat Last, a bold framework for leadership in today’s ever-changing world. How do we win a game that has no end? Finite games, like football or chess, have known players, fixed rules and a clear endpoint. The winners and losers are easily identified. Infinite games, games with no finish line, like business or politics, or life itself, have players who come and go. The rules of an infinite game are changeable while infinite games have no defined endpoint. There are no winners or losers—only ahead and behind. The question is, how do we play to succeed in the game we’re in? In this revelatory book, Simon Sinek offers a framework for leading with an infinite mindset. On one hand, none of us can resist the fleeting thrills of a promotion earned or a tournament won, yet these rewards fade quickly. In pursuit of a Just Cause, we will commit to a vision of a future world so appealing that we will build it week after week, month after month, year after year. Although we do not know the exact form this world will take, working toward it gives our work and our life meaning. Leaders who embrace an infinite mindset build stronger, more innovative, more inspiring organizations. Ultimately, they are the ones who lead us into the future.">

Grace Bennett has always dreamed of moving to the city, but the bunkers and drawn curtains that she finds on her arrival are not what she expected. And she certainly never imagined she’d wind up working at Primrose Hill, a dusty old bookshop nestled in the heart of London.

A BuzzFeed Best Summer Read of 2021 When a fake relationship between scientists meets the irresistible force of attraction, it throws one woman&#39;s carefully calculated theories on love into chaos. As a third-year Ph.D. candidate, Olive Smith doesn&#39;t believe in lasting romantic relationships—but her best friend does, and that&#39;s what got her into this situation. Convincing Anh that Olive is dating and well on her way to a happily ever after was always going to take more than hand-wavy Jedi mind tricks: Scientists require proof. So, like any self-respecting biologist, Olive panics and kisses the first man she sees. That man is none other than Adam Carlsen, a young hotshot professor—and well-known ass. Which is why Olive is positively floored when Stanford&#39;s reigning lab tyrant agrees to keep her charade a secret and be her fake boyfriend. But when a big science conference goes haywire, putting Olive&#39;s career on the Bunsen burner, Adam surprises her again with his unyielding support and even more unyielding...six-pack abs. Suddenly their little experiment feels dangerously close to combustion. And Olive discovers that the only thing more complicated than a hypothesis on love is putting her own heart under the microscope.">

But almost everything she&#39;s told them about herself is a lie. And she might just have got away with it, if it weren’t for her husband’s job. Leo is an obituary writer; Emma a well-known marine biologist. When she suffers a serious illness, Leo copes by doing what he knows best – researching and writing about his wife’s life. But as he starts to unravel the truth, he discovers the woman he loves doesn’t really exist. Even her name isn’t real. When the very darkest moments of Emma’s past finally emerge, she must somehow prove to Leo that she really is the woman he always thought she was . . . But first, she must tell him about the other love of her life. *Publishers Weekly starred review">

They’re a fundamental part of our lives. In The Power of Regret, Pink explains how we can enlist our regrets to make smarter decisions, perform better and deepen our sense of meaning and purpose. Drawing on the largest sampling of attitudes about regret ever conducted from his own World Regret Survey, Pink identifies the four core regrets that most people have. With his signature blend of big ideas and practical takeaways, captivating stories and crisp humour, he argues that by understanding what people regret the most, we can understand what they value the most.

In Mitch Albom’s profound new novel of hope and faith, a group of shipwrecked passengers pull a strange man from the sea. He claims to be “the Lord.” And he says he can only save them if they all believe in him. Adrift in a raft after a deadly ship explosion, ten people struggle for survival at sea. Three days pass. Short on water, food and hope, they spot a man floating in the waves. They pull him in. “Thank the Lord we found you,” a passenger says. “I am the Lord,” the man whispers. So begins Mitch Albom’s most beguiling novel yet. Albom has written of heaven in the celebrated number one bestsellers The Five People You Meet in Heaven and The First Phone Call from Heaven. Now, for the first time in his fiction, he ponders what we would do if, after crying out for divine help, God actually appeared before us? In The Stranger in the Lifeboat, Albom keeps us guessing until the end: Is this strange man really who he claims to be? What actually happened to cause the explosion? Are the survivors in heaven, or are they in hell? The story is narrated by Benji, one of the passengers, who recounts the events in a notebook that is discovered—a year later—when the empty life raft washes up on the island of Montserrat. It falls to the island’s chief inspector, Jarty LeFleur, a man battling his own demons, to solve the mystery of what really happened. A fast-paced, compelling novel that makes you ponder your deepest beliefs, The Stranger in the Lifeboat suggests that answers to our prayers may be found where we least expect them.">

            <div class="book-card" data-full-description="New York Times and Wall Street Journal bestseller A step-by-step plan clinically proven to break the cycle of worry and fear that drives anxiety and addictive habits We are living through one of the most anxious periods any of us can remember. Whether facing issues as public as a pandemic or as personal as having kids at home and fighting the urge to reach for the wine bottle every night, we are feeling overwhelmed and out of control. But in this timely book, Judson Brewer explains how to uproot anxiety at its source using brain-based techniques and small hacks accessible to anyone. We think of anxiety as everything from mild unease to full-blown panic. But it&#39;s also what drives the addictive behaviors and bad habits we use to cope (e.g. stress eating, procrastination, doom scrolling and social media). Plus, anxiety lives in a part of the brain that resists rational thought. So we get stuck in anxiety habit loops that we can&#39;t think our way out of or use willpower to overcome. Dr. Brewer teaches us to map our brains to discover our triggers, defuse them with the simple but powerful practice of curiosity, and to train our brains using mindfulness and other practices that his lab has proven can work. Distilling more than 20 years of research and hands-on work with thousands of patients, including Olympic athletes and coaches, and leaders in government and business, Dr. Brewer has created a clear, solution-oriented program that anyone can use to feel better - no matter how anxious they feel.">

One of those rare books that surprise you along the way and then linger in your mind long after you have finished it.” —Kristin Hannah, #1 New York Times bestselling author of The Nightingale and The Four Winds Right. Wrong. Life is lived somewhere in between. Duchess Day Radley is a thirteen-year-old self-proclaimed outlaw. Rules are for other people. She is the fierce protector of her five-year-old brother, Robin, and the parent to her mother, Star, a single mom incapable of taking care of herself, let alone her two kids. Walk has never left the coastal California town where he and Star grew up. He may have become the chief of police, but he’s still trying to heal the old wound of having given the testimony that sent his best friend, Vincent King, to prison decades before. And he&#39;s in overdrive protecting Duchess and her brother. Now, thirty years later, Vincent is being released. And Duchess and Walk must face the trouble that comes with his return. We Begin at the End is an extraordinary novel about two kinds of families—the ones we are born into and the ones we create.">

            <div class="book-card" data-full-description="Ben Horowitz, a leading venture capitalist, modern management expert, and New York Times bestselling author, combines lessons both from history and from modern organizational practice with practical and often surprising advice to help executives build cultures that can weather both good and bad times. Ben Horowitz has long been fascinated by history, and particularly by how people behave differently than you’d expect. The time and circumstances in which they were raised often shapes them—yet a few leaders have managed to shape their times. In What You Do Is Who You Are, he turns his attention to a question crucial to every organization: how do you create and sustain the culture you want? To Horowitz, culture is how a company makes decisions. It is the set of assumptions employees use to resolve everyday problems: should I stay at the Red Roof Inn, or the Four Seasons? Should we discuss the color of this product for five minutes or thirty hours? If culture is not purposeful, it will be an accident or a mistake. What You Do Is Who You Are explains how to make your culture purposeful by spotlighting four models of leadership and culture-building—the leader of the only successful slave revolt, Haiti’s Toussaint Louverture; the Samurai, who ruled Japan for seven hundred years and shaped modern Japanese culture; Genghis Khan, who built the world’s largest empire; and Shaka Senghor, a man convicted of murder who ran the most formidable prison gang in the yard and ultimately transformed prison culture. Horowitz connects these leadership examples to modern case-studies, including how Louverture’s cultural techniques were applied (or should have been) by Reed Hastings at Netflix, Travis Kalanick at Uber, and Hillary Clinton, and how Genghis Khan’s vision of cultural inclusiveness has parallels in the work of Don Thompson, the first African-American CEO of McDonalds, and of Maggie Wilderotter, the CEO who led Frontier Communications. Horowitz then offers guidance to help any company understand its own strategy and build a successful culture. What You Do Is Who You Are is a journey through culture, from ancient to modern. Along the way, it answers a question fundamental to any organization: who are we? How do people talk about us when we’re not around? How do we treat our customers? Are we there for people in a pinch? Can we be trusted? Who you are is not the values you list on the wall. It’s not what you say in company-wide meeting. It’s not your marketing campaign. It’s not even what you believe. Who you are is what you do. This book aims to help you do the things you need to become the kind of leader you want to be—and others want to follow.">
